Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any  problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
*AzureDB - [Download & Install AzureDB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15).

### Downloading SamiRoom

There are several ways you can get the SamiRoom boilerplate:

### Cloning The GitHub Repository
The recommended way to get SamiRoom is to use git to directly clone the SamiRoon repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/shaiidan/web-project.git
```

This will clone the latest version of the SamiRoom repository to a **web-project** folder.

### Downloading The Repository Zip File
Another way to use the SamiRoom boilerplate is to download a zip copy from the [master branch on GitHub](https://github.com/shaiidan/web-project/archive/master.zip). You can also do this using the `wget` command:

```bash
$ wget https://github.com/shaiidan/web-project/archive/master.zip -O web-project.zip; unzip web-project.zip; rm web-project.zip
```

## Quick Install

Once you've downloaded the boilerplate and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from upload the site - 
The boilerplate comes pre-bundled with a `package.json` files that contain the list of modules you need to start your application.

To install the dependencies, run this in the application folder from the command-line:

```bash
$ npm install
```

This command does a few things:
* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.
* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.
* When the npm packages install process is over, npm will initiate a bower install command to install all the front-end modules needed for the application

## Running Your Application

Run your application using npm:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Your application should run on port 3000 with the *development* environment configuration, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

That's it! Your application should be running. To proceed with your development, check the other sections in this documentation.


## Running the tests

Run test application using npm:

```bash
$ npm test
```
## Running test linter

Run linter test application using npm:

```bash
$ npm npm install eslint
$ npx eslint /**
```
